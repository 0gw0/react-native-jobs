# React Native Jobs App

This is a simple phone application practice built with React Native. It helps users find jobs using the jSearch API. The app features a search bar, popular jobs, and nearby jobs on the home screen. Users can filter their job search by full-time, part-time, or contractor positions, or use the search bar to find more jobs.
